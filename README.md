# Image-Caption-Project-
Using Flickr8k dataset since the size is 1GB. MS-COCO is 14GB!

Used Keras with Tensorflow backend for the code. VGG is used for extracting the features.


The loss value of 2.4787 has been achieved which gives good results. You can check out some examples below. The rest of the examples are in the jupyter notebook. You can run the Jupyter Notebook and try out your own examples. 

Everything is implemented in the Jupyter notebook which will hopefully make it easier to understand the code.

I have also written a blog post describing my experience while implementing this project. You can find it here.
